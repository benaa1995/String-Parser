# String-Parser

In this exercise, a string parser is implemented in the C language. You must receive a sentence of one or more words from the user and print on the screen the number of words received, the words themselves and their length.

If the input received is "Good morning sir", then the output will be:
3 words
Good: 4
morning: 7
sir: 3
